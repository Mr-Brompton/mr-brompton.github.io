    <strong>Laptop Review</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Lenovo 100s with OS Windows 10
</p>
<p>
    ***
</p>
<p>
    Â£149.99
</p>
<p>
    Only available second-hand...
</p>
<p>
    This is a bog standard laptop that I purchased after ruining my good one. I
    needed something cheap and this does the job. It runs basic games with ease
    and will handle all of my writing needs. The only drawback is windows 10
    and its insessant notifications. For example everyday, at least twice per
    day I get a 'purchase microsoft office' notification wich at the very least
    can be very annoying. If I didn't want to purchase it 4 hours ago why would
    I have changed my mind now?
</p>
<p>
    Its battery life has suited me greatly however. As long as I have
    remembered to charge the battery it has never run out on me. That being
    said I am reasonably energy conscious and run my computer at a reasonable
    efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    I have used each one of its functions, HDMI out, headphone/microphone jack,
    micro SD card slot, 2X USB inputs and have had no problems using bluetooth
    devices.
</p>
<p>
    If your looking for something with all of the bells and whistles this isn't
    it. But if you just need to run basic applications and softwares and want
    something reasonably durable, practical and compact it is the perfect
    wallet suitable solution.
