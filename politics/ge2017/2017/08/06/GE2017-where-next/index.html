<p><strong>The election is over. The results are in. Theresa May has failed to gain her mandate for a strong and stable leadership and while Labour didn’t win, they grew big time. Since the result of a hung parliament has become clear, Theresa May has been scrambling for more seats to form a majority and with the LibDems still reeling from their last encounter with the blues, there was only ever going to be one choice for the aspiring Prime Minister. The DUP.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Signpost.jpg" alt="Signpost to the left 2070 to the right 1870" /></p>

<h2 id="who-are-the-dup">Who are the DUP?</h2>

<p>The Democratic Unionist Party describe themselves as a party ‘to maintain and enhance Northern Ireland’s constitutional position within the United Kingdom, achieving long-term political stability to deliver a peaceful and prosperous future for our people. ‘ Sounds fair. I may consider writing a full overview of them later on if you’d like to read it comment below - but for now, they are a party with about 10 seats in Parliament and have been reported to be anti-women’s rights, anti gay-rights and deniers of climate change. That said, many of their policies on education and infrastructure are sound and the party leans toward a ‘soft-brexit’ approach. So, not all bad.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-theresa-may">What does this mean for Theresa May?</h2>

<p>This is quite an interesting move from Theresa – although she wasn’t left with much choice. The DUP are the only party willing to enter a deal with enough seats for the Tories to reach the 326 required. The partnership will give Northern Ireland a much stronger position at the negotiating table for BREXIT meaning we may hear the DUP’s views on a hard border more but for me the interesting BREXIT point is that the DUP are a looking for a ‘soft-brexit’, a long way out from May’s war-cry of ‘No deal’. This could mean we may have saved the day in terms of the BREXIT negotiations but then… we all remember how well the LibDems did in Coalition with Cameron when the liberals had 57 seats.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-results-say-about-the-uk-how-is-this-reflected-in-parliament">What do the results say about the UK? How is this reflected in Parliament?</h2>

<p>There is no denying a massive swing to the left this time around with the first real liberal-left manifesto from any main party in years securing a huge increase for the Labour Party. The question… Does the house of commons now represent the people it leads? Short answer, No.</p>

<p>With such a massive surge to the left in both constituency seats and vote share we would expect that our representatives can put up a fair fight – and they can but this doesn’t mean squat next to the coalition now (almost) in power.</p>

<p>I should explain a little. In British Government both sides can put their ideas on the table. The opposition however, get almost none of these ideas through. Without a majority of 326 it is difficult to persuade enough MP’s to vote in your favour. Often The Government sweeps these ideas under the carpet. (Sometimes to resurface later with the leading parties logo.)</p>

<p>It is much easier in opposition to persuade a couple Government backbenchers to vote against their own party. This means that the best the left can now hope for is a strong leash tied to the neck of May while hoping NHS privatisation, human rights losses, restriction of freedom of speech, fracking, tax-hikes for the poor, tax cuts for the rich and service cuts will be much more difficult for the PM to push through the house.</p>

<p>In short, for now we are fighting a right-wing political agenda as a Conservative coalition with an even further right DUP means we are unable to push forward with progressive policies. I hope you’ve been practicing your parry Mr. Corbyn, you will need it.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-labour">What does this mean for Labour?</h2>

<p>Labour seem to have passed their crossroads. Just a few months ago a bitter civil war threatened to destroy the party. This election gave a huge mandate to move away from the centre right politics of the previous decades. Labour now have good reason to entrench themselves in the House of Commons using a progressive manifesto the likes of whichKeir Hardie would be proud. All of this with an unknown back-bencher at the helm who beat odds of 1-100 to become party leader.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-this-mean-for-corbyn">What does this mean for Corbyn?</h2>

<p>Just a few days into Government and you can bet your last penny that there are ‘anti-Corbyn’ MP’s plotting his demise. With such a strong voter turnout (many of them new voters) it will be difficult to say he is unpopular in the light of his epic defence in Labour’s recent civil war and his valiant fight for number 10. All of this amid one of the dirtiest smear campaigns witnessed in a lifetime, suggesting a weak Corbyn is now impossible.</p>

<p>So we will have a man who genuinely seems to have a good heart (the unicorn of politicians) at the head of the opposition. With any luck it will remain so for some time to come. We must remember though, that May will not want another election soon, in fact the Labour leader could be a ripe old age of 75 before May chances the polling station again.</p>

<p>This makes things look stark for the future of the progressive left, which is why we must keep fighting.</p>

<h2 id="is-it-all-over">Is it all over?</h2>

<p>Another short answer here. No.</p>

<p>The Blues are weaker, Labour is Stronger but it must remain so if labour have a chance in hell of bending the Government in the right direction. In most elections the mere act of voting is enough, in this one the vote is only the beginning.</p>

<p>There is still a small glint of hope. Before the ConDem coalition of 2010 we had one other ‘hung parliament’ in living memory (admittedly not my living memory!). In 1974 the Conservative PM Mr. Heath called an election in order to “return a strong government with a firm mandate” to power. Sound familiar? After a hard-fought campaign on both sides, Heath lost his majority and attempted to form a coalition. This coalition didn’t last long and broke down within weeks. This allowed the Labour leader Harold Wilson to form a minority government which did surprisingly well. All of this soon lead to another early election in which Labour’s mandate was secured.</p>

<p>It is easy to see the parallels here and one would have hoped that PM May would have known all about this story and learned from the past. This wasn’t the case but perhaps Mr. Corbyn can use history to his advantage. Perhaps this time next week… with pressure put into all the right places, Mr. Corbyn can take his rainbow alliance into their rightful place in No. 10.</p>

<p>Alas, excluding the potential collapse of the coalition Corbyns best hopes of reaching No.10* may have died – unless we can push May for another early election. With this battle almost won, we haven’t yet lost the war. There are other candidates that could push Corbyns agenda once he steps down. John McDonnell is one who comes to mind but in the meantime there are plenty of other ways we can fight the power.</p>

<h2 id="what-can-now-be-done">What can now be done?</h2>

<p>If you voted to Save the NHS, for tax increases for the top 5%, for a crackdown on tax avoidance, for free school meals, for the environment or just because you don’t like May here are a few things you can do to take up the fight.</p>
