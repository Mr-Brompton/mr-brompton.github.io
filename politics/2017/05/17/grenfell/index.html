<p><strong>Last week we saw a tragedy the like of which is unthinkable and unseen here in the UK, the tragic deaths of many men, women and children trapped inside a towering inferno. Our hearts go out to all of those who lost their lives, who must live with horrific injuries and who will never see their loved ones again and of course, to those who we may never identify. Another Blog Blog also wish to thank the Community, the emergency services and the public who have come together in an amazing show of humanity. At first this post was intending look into the fire in great detail but after conducting research some disturbing information has come to light. Information I feel the need to share across the country.</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/Grenfell_Tower_fire_morning.jpg" alt="Jeremy-Corbyn-IRA-Terrorist" /></p>

<h2 id="the-issue">The Issue</h2>

<p>We should begin at the start of the trail, looking at the possibility that the fire was preventable. With reports focusing on the poor safety standards and external cladding of the building, Another Blog Blog fear that something big is being missed. These measures, although important to minimise the risk to life when such incidents occur do not in themselves stop these horrible tragedies. There is no doubt a case to hear of corporate manslaughter through negligence by the Housing Management Organisation and the Council but the question here is ‘Was this preventable’. To understand this, we must look at the ‘cause’ of the fire.</p>

<p>Many reports on the night suggested that the fire may have started with a faulty fridge. Behailu Kebede, a taxi driver who lived on the fourth floor admitted he thought this would be a small fire and was told by emergency services it could be kept under control. Sadly, we know this was not the case.</p>

<p>We should remember that the fire experts have not yet concluded their investigation into the cause of the fire however Mr. Behailu’s testimony corroborates with other tenant’s reports. It also matches with what <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1210334/Alert-new-wave-exploding-fridges-caused-environmentally-friendly-coolant.html#ixzz4kNl3PwK4">Graeme Fox, an air-conditioning and refrigeration contractor told The Mail back in 2009</a>.</p>

<div class="quot">"During the day when the fridge door is frequently opened there isn't a problem. 'But at night, when everyone is sleeping and the door remains shut, this leaked highly flammable gas can build up in the fridge cabinet"
<span class="ref">- Graeme Fox</span></div>

<p>Domestic fridge explosions seem to be on the increase. Another Blog Blog has found numerous reports that seem to start around 2010 of refrigerators exploding in this manner and so we looked into it further. Isobutane seems to be the cause here.</p>

<div class="quot">"Similar explosions with similar consequences have also occurred in homes across Europe and the Far East where domestic fridges now use flammable isobutane as the refrigerant. In these incidents, explosions have occurred if, due to a fault in the refrigerator, the flammable refrigerant has been able to leak into the refrigerator compartment."<span class="ref"><a href="http://www.coolingpost.com/world-news/lab-explosion-due-to-domestic-fridge/"><br />- Coolpost</a></span></div>

<p>Reports surfaced in 2009 of refrigerators with the compound isobutane exploding when leaked into the refrigeration compartment. Reports seem to have been largely ignored by the press, government and public. Jane Gartshore, president of the Institute of Refrigeration speaking to the telegraph stated that this is “theoretically possible” but “There are hundreds of millions of these fridges and these incidents are very rare.”</p>

<p>Rarity may be the case, but as seen in an <a href="http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/investigation-what-caused-massive-explosion-11149998">explosion that destroyed a house in Birmingham</a> surely the potential dangers outweigh the rarity. It is rare that an aeroplane crashes and kills its passengers, but safety measures still have to be in place to prevent these horrific disasters. Why is it not the same for appliance manufacturers?</p>

<p>It is difficult to find statistics in the UK, perhaps a freedom of information request to HMRC or the companies in question could reveal the information but this will take time. In the meantime there are two places we can look for information</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/news/LatestNewsReleases_gaping-hole-in-fridge-freezer-safety.asp#.WUbbN1TyvIU">LFB produced a report</a> in Feb this year stating that there has been at least one fire per day in the capital alone since 2011 with eight deaths and aproximately 120 injuries. That number could be about to increase significantly.</p>

<p>We should note that the company names most often surfacing in the reports of exploding fridges are Indecit, Hotpoint, Creda, Beko and Samsung.</p>

<p>As we have seen with the recent Whirlpool, Indecit, Hotpoint and Creda tumble drier fires, companies with vested interest in the story not ‘getting out’ often show a serious lack of willingness to act. This is hardly a suprise but it would seem prudent that any inquest or inquiry into the matter should question if not prosecute company directors if it can be shown that a similar lack of response has infact caused the deaths of hundreds of people with whole families including children condemned to a tragic, painful and needless death. With over 300 million fridges worldwide using this technology reported in 2009 this could be a classic example of coorperate manslaughter through negligenance on a scale not precidented here in the UK.</p>

<p>There is a chance however, for these companies to put this right and YOU CAN HELP. UK manufacturers are about to produce a report for the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), the body that sets the global standards for manufacturing fridges and freezers on safety standards for future appliances. The LFB are campaiging for stronger safegaurds to be in place that include the use of fireproof material on the back of every refridgerator and could mean the difference between fridge A and fridge B in the video below.</p>

<iframe class="youtube" width="854" height="480" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pvko16hqJ7g" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>This video shows how a fireproof backing can buy the vital time needed for the fire service to respond. The first fridge burns out of control within 20 seconds yet the fridge with the fireproof backing just smoulders for over 20 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-help">How to help</h2>

<p>The LFB are our heroes. They put their lives on the line daily to defend our lives in the front line and lead campaigns for change in the industry. You can <a href="http://www.london-fire.gov.uk/total-recalls-white-goods-campaign.asp">support the LFB’s total recall campaign</a> which aims to create a single register of known faulty appliances reducing the number of needless deaths.</p>

<p>You can also <a href="http://www.parliament.uk/get-involved/contact-your-mp/">contact your MP</a>, asking them to raise the concerns of the LFB in parliament, back any calls to make appliances safer and to apply pressure to British manufacturers to amend their proposals in line with the LFB’s advice.</p>

<p>You can find information on preventing this type of fire from <a href="http://www.ukfiretraining.com/news/fridge-freezer-fires.html">UKFireTraining.com</a>. Remember to fit and check a smoke alarm as seen in the affiliate link to the right. It could be the difference between life and death.</p>

<p>This information could help save lives. It could help to bring some meaning to the deaths of those so tragically lost. Share it far and wide – Not for ABB but for those children who never had a chance and whose last breathes where the most painful imaginable. Thank you for reading.</p>
