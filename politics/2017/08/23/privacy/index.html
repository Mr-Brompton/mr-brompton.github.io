<p><strong>I remember a happy childhood, often in response to my outrageous style or strong political views I cited the common phrase ‘It’s a free country’, under the notion that if I hadn’t committed a crime, I was a free person with no reason to assume I was under surveillance or investigation. This has all changed. Here in the UK, we now live in the most watched state in the world. Under the guise of security theatre, the threat of terrorism has meant we have given unprecedented access of our lives to the Government, and in the same breathe everyone else who has an internet connection. So what’s the problem? I have nothing to hide so why should I be concerned?</strong></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/1984.jpg" alt="1984 extract" /></p>

<h2 id="the-problems-with-ipa">The problems with IPA:</h2>

<p>Not only was the <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/tech-policy/2016/11/investigatory-powers-act-privacy-disaster-waiting-to-happen/">IPA pushed through without proper parliamentary debate</a>, It was done so using extremely dirty tactics meaning the act was enforceable before any serious opposition could be brought.</p>

<p>Even before the act many innocent people were being watched despite no previous criminal offences, links to criminal organisations or a background of any criminal activity.</p>

<div class="quot">&quot;The most extreme surveilance in the history of western democracy&quot;<span class="ref">- Edward Snowden</span></div>

<p>During the tenure of the acts predecessor, Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 (RIPA),  while investigating the pleb-gate scandal <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/media-blog/2014/sep/08/regulation-investigatory-powers-act-snoopers-charter">The Police accessed the records of Newton Dunn</a> in order to ascertain the identity of the ‘anonymous source’ who had revealed the information. This was then used to punish the whistle-blowers concerned. This type of action will make it extremely difficult for anyone suspecting foul-play to report it anonymously. It doesn’t stop there.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public">Midlothian council used the act to spy on people feeding pidgeons</a>,   <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/dec/25/british-councils-used-investigatory-powers-ripa-to-secretly-spy-on-public">Lancaster city council spied on dog walkers</a>, there are endless lists of minor infractions being used as reason to survail large groups of innocent people.</p>

<p>All of the above cases were covered by RIPA and as such required the permission of the courts to enact, the new bill however bypasses such controls and puts your information, phone calls, text messages and the rest of it directly into the hands of the department concerned.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-risks">What are the risks?</h2>

<p>So if I have nothing to hide I shouldn’t be concerned? If that is the argument against mass surveillance it can be blown out of the water with these simple stories:</p>

<p>Cindy B is a social worker from Canada, with no criminal record, or even a parking ticket to her name. She raised issues about funding to the Canadian Government, after which she became paranoid that she was being watched and so she submitted a request to view the information about her that the Canadian Government held. The results were surprising.</p>

<div class="quot">&quot;I filed for any documents the department would have about me, and a year and a half later, that DVD arrives in the mail and I thought it’d be a quick view, and I saw one document after another document. Email exchanges, copies of my emails. There was pictures off of my Facebook page. They had screenshots, but they were also following my personal movements. Not only was there copies of different types of talks I was at. There was notes of a talk I did in the middle of the desert of Australia and they weren’t just following me. They were following other people in my circle.&quot;<span class="ref">- Cindy B</span></div>

<h3 id="how-can-this-information-be-miss-used">How can this information be miss-used?</h3>

<p>Here is another story,</p>

<p>Cassidy Wolf was Miss Teen USA. Her browser had a defect in it and that defect allowed someone who had installed what’s called drive by malware on a website and this guy, he got indecent nude images of Cassidy, who was a minor child at the time, he said, “I now have your social media passwords and I have these pictures of you naked, standing in front of your computer, when you were getting dressed in the morning. I’m going to dump them all onto your social media unless you perform live sex acts on camera,”</p>

<p>This hacker was eventually caught after inflicting similar experiences on hundreds of people.</p>

<p><a href="https://irlpodcast.org/episode5/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=irl&amp;utm_content=iot-survey">stories from IRL by Mozilla</a></p>

<p>You might think ‘That could never happen’ or ‘It won’t happen to me’, you may trust the people responsible for securing the data to keep it safe but the nature of the internet is, once it’s online it’s never going away. The best way to stay safe is to ensure the data doesn’t exist in the first place.</p>

<p>And here is the main problem with this the IPA, it makes the data available not only to those who might need it to fight crime, but to those who can, and will use it against you.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-the-government-or-large-cooperations-decide-they-are-against-you">What happens when the Government, or large cooperations decide THEY are against you?</h3>

<p>During the Dakota access pipeline protests, energy transfer partners - The company behind the pipeline hired a private surveillance company to watch the protesters. Although it can’t be proven that anything happened with this information, often the pipelines defence was one step ahead of the protesters and used extreme tactics to attempt to disperse them. With Large US corporations beginning to frack our gorgeous country and laying their oily hands on our NHS what makes us think they won’t use similar tactics against protesters here in the UK?</p>

<h2 id="does-this-type-of-surveillance-work">Does this type of surveillance work?</h2>

<p>The sad truth is, not only does this type of surveillance not work it is actually counter productive. <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn26801-mass-surveillance-not-effective-for-finding-terrorists/">New Scientist has reported that Surveillance of the entire population, the vast majority of whom are innocent, leads to the diversion of limited intelligence resources in pursuit of huge numbers of false leads. Terrorists are comparatively rare, so finding one is a needle in a haystack problem</a>. While <a href="https://www.counterpunch.org/2006/05/24/why-does-the-nsa-engage-in-mass-surveillance-of-americans-when-it-s-statistically-impossible-for-such-spying-to-detect-terrorists/">Floyd Rudmin goes a step further and shows us the maths behind the problem</a> .</p>

<p>Does the IPA still make you feel safer? For me, it certainly does not.</p>

<h2 id="who-can-access-our-data">Who can access our data?</h2>

<p>There is a huge <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/investigatory-powers-bill-act-snoopers-charter-browsing-history-what-does-it-mean-a7436251.html">list of authorities legally able to access your browsing history</a> including the DWP, meaning, if you are unemployed and sign on, your advisor may be able to see exactly how long you watched that cat video for. A darker mind might suggest they could see the exactly how long you were watching porn last night and which videos did it for you.. Although this is a problem in itself, this is just the tip of a very large iceberg.</p>

<p>As was stated earlier, the only way to keep the data 100% safe is to ensure it doesn’t exist in the first place, but allowing such a wide number of people access without proper judicial permissions only serves to increase the risk of the information falling into the wrong hands. There are some very smart, dumb people out there who know how to exploit us if they get the right piece of information. Getting hold of it couldn’t be easier and it is only a matter of time before we see this information made available on the dark-web or worse.</p>

<h2 id="what-data-can-be-accessed">What data can be accessed?</h2>

<p>Your full browsing history from the last year.
Voice and Video recordings (Thankfully only with a warrant)
NHS and similar Records,
Who you speak to, how long for, when and where.
Your geographic location,
MP’s Communictaons (With permission of the PM)</p>

<p>Scary huh?</p>

<h2 id="what-can-i-do-to-protect-myself">What can I do to protect myself?</h2>

<p>Well it’s not all doom and gloom, There are some brilliant ways to negate this problem.</p>

<p>Use a VPN, for example <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B071GDC48J/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=B071GDC48J&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mrbrompton-21&amp;linkId=510552caee7565a30a5d894240ed7784">IP Vanish VPN</a> To hide your personal details and location. This is VITAL is you are using public Wi-Fi.</p>

<p>Use a <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B073XM9JLM/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mrbrompton-21&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=B073XM9JLM&amp;linkId=b342b6ed04df572fa0c4a36895237e04">Webcam Cover</a>. Olivia London does it. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg does it. So does former FBI director James Comey.</p>

<p>Use Private Browsing – This will mean your browsing history is not stored locally and no personal data can be accessed from your machine.</p>

<p>Get informed, Listen to <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1478945567/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1634&amp;creative=6738&amp;creativeASIN=1478945567&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=mrbrompton-21&amp;linkId=e841f5c19aef26d67062088a1b61789e">The Art of Invisibility: The World’s Most Famous Hacker Teaches You How to Be Safe in the Age of Big Brother and Big Data</a> for free on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Audible-Free-Trial-Digital-Membership/dp/B00OPA2XFG?tag=mrbrompton-21">Audible with a free 30-day trial</a>.
