<h2 id="traditional-computers">Traditional Computers</h2>
<p>“Computers are machines that process data into information under the control of a stored program.” (R. Newman, 2002[a])</p>

<h3 id="bits-bytes-and-logic-gates">Bits, Bytes and logic gates</h3>
<p>At the very heart of every computer is a series of transistors. Transistors can be thought of as switches that can represent two states; 1 (ON) and 0 (OFF). The more transistors we have, the more states we can represent. With just one transistor two states of information may be represented, if we add a second transistor we gain the ability to represent four possible states, or any number from 0 to 3. Each digit is known as a bit – or binary digit. The possible number of representations is equal to 2n where n = the number of bits. Operations are performed on stored binary data using logic gates. There are many different types of logic gates, far too many to go into for the purposes of this blog. (F. Wempen, 2014)</p>

<h3 id="exponential-growth">Exponential Growth</h3>
<p>A visualisation of the representations possible with multiple binary digits can be made using the Indian Rice Fable. A wise merchant invented the game of chess. The merchant requested that for the first square on a chess board he be paid 1 grain of rice with the number of grains doubling on each additional square. The Emperor agreed to this proposal and buy the time the 64th square was reached 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 grains of rice were owed. Adding binary digits adds new possibilities for encoding by the same order of magnitude. This is called exponential Growth. (Anon, No Date)</p>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>
<p>With 8-bits we can represent 256 possible states or characters. If we agree on a ‘code’ for these characters, it becomes possible to communicate between computers using the main characters and punctuation marks of the English Language. Fortunately for computer users, this code was established by the Americans in the form of American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) in the early 60’s (Anon, 2017[a]). Further character encodings have arisen, most notably Unicode, which represents thousands more characters. (Anon, 2017[b])</p>

<h3 id="in-the-beginning">In the beginning</h3>
<p>In the early field of computer science were two gentlemen, Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith who contributed significantly during the industrial revolution. Babbage built the world’s first differential equation machine and the first general purpose machine ‘The Analytical Engine’. Hollerith built a machine which could compile results mechanically using a program and perforated cards. Hollerith even went on to start IBM. (R. Newman, 2002[b])</p>

<h3 id="level-1">Level 1</h3>
<p>Between the 1945 and 1956 the first generation of computers were developed which used magnetic tubes in place of transistors. With the first-generation computers, two leaps forward were made. Memory that could hold stored programs and central processing units (CPUs) were developed. This first generation of computers relied on machine language; the lowest level language understood by machines and could only work on one problem at a time. (R. Newman, 2002[b])</p>

<h3 id="next-gen">Next Gen</h3>
<p>This led to the second generation of computers. It is here computers began to develop the parts we would associate with them today. Transistors replaced magnetic tubes allowing for smaller machines while printers, tape storage, disk storage, memory, operating systems and stored programs became commonplace. The high-level languages Common Business Oriented Language (COBOL) and Formula Translation (FORTRAN) were also developed. These leaps forward gave birth to the software industry as we know it today. (R. Newman, 2002[b])</p>

<p>The second generation of computing is when the possibilities posed by computers really took hold of the public imagination. Computers became commonplace in popular culture with TV shows like ‘The Avengers’ which showed the potential application of AI as well some of the dangers of more advanced computers. ‘The Jetsons’ showed the potential for robotics technology and a life of leisure while ‘Star Trek’ showed a future space travelling utopia – all made possible using computers.</p>

<h3 id="fast-forward">Fast forward</h3>
<p>Over the next 30 years we would pass through the third and fourth generations of computing. During this time computers were gaining speed and losing size year on year. This made them accessible to businesses and the public alike. Early versions of the internet were developed in the early 80’s such as ARPANET. Between 1982 and 1992 the number of computers in use grew from 2 million to 65 million. Arguably Tim Berners Lee was the greatest contributor to this when he invented the internet as we know it today. (R. Newman, 2002[b])</p>

<h3 id="moores-law">Moore’s Law</h3>
<p>The rapid growth of computational power in the 20th century was characterised in 1965 by Gordon Moore in Moore’s Law. Put simply, Moore suggested that computers would half in size and double in speed every two years because of the number of transistors able to fit into a CPU (Fuller, 2010). This trend would continue for many decades until transistors became so small that quantum mechanics come into play and electron leakage became a problem (Peper, 2017). The rate of progression is starting to slow and for computer science to take another leap forward – new breakthroughs will have to be made.</p>

<p>Up until this point breakthroughs in computing were made by adding higher levels of computer abstraction as shown in Fig 1 and improving CPU speed. What happens when computers have near human-level processing and understanding of the world? AI projects such as Alpha Go’s DeepMind seem already to be at this level. It would be difficult if not impossible to create higher abstraction levels then humans can understand. The solution? Build lower level mechanics. (Patil, 2016)</p>

<h2 id="the-quantum-age">The Quantum Age</h2>

<h3 id="problem">Problem:</h3>
<p>Once the technology is so small we are manipulating single electrons things start getting weird. Electrons begin to behave very differently on the quantum level and this unpredictability can cause serious computational errors with traditional transistors. At this level electrons can escape the circuit through Quantum Tunnelling (Kurzgesagt – In a Nutshell, 2015). Although the difference between 1 and 0 seems small – if we are speaking to a launch control unit for a space rocket the difference could be to launch, or not to launch.</p>

<h3 id="electron---the-ultimate-superhero">Electron - The Ultimate Superhero</h3>
<p>This inherent instability does have its uses. Electrons at this level can be polarized vertically or horizontally – while also simultaneously being every possible combination of the two. The catch is, it can only be in one of the middle states while it is not being measured. As soon as the electron is measured it must choose its state (Altepeter, 2010). It sounds difficult to imagine but Schrodinger explains the concept beautifully with his cat.</p>

<h3 id="dead-cat-theory">Dead Cat Theory</h3>
<p>Schrodinger proposes that if we put a cat in a box and seal the box we have no way of knowing for sure if the cat is alive or dead. It is only when we open the box that the cat’s state of living is determined (Merz, 2013). This is exactly how Quantum Bits (Qubits) work. The ability to be 1, 0 and any combination in between is called super-positioning and this allows for some real next-level computing.</p>

<h3 id="qubits---amazeballs-irl">Qubits - Amazeballs IRL</h3>
<p>We discussed the things made possible with eight-bits. 8-qubits however, may calculate all 256 possible combinations at once. 20-qubits can calculate over 1 million possibilities instantaneously. IBM recently announced it’s first 50 Qubit computer. The possibilities are phenomenal. (Galeon, 2017)</p>

<h3 id="superpositioned-posibilities">Superpositioned posibilities</h3>
<p>This ability gives Quantum Computing exciting application prospects. Big data projects like meteorology and statistical evaluation will be revolutionised and possibilities for AI are astronomical. Supply chains, medicine and the financial services sector will all be transformed for the better. It could be that the computers revolutionise the way we live and work, performing quantum simulations that lead to a ‘Star Trek’ type future in which we travel across galaxies warping space and time while performing calculations that in turn bring an end to scarcity, disease and the energy crises (IBM, No Date). Or, quantum computers could do little more than increase supply chain efficiency reducing the cost of bananas. In this way, quantum computers could be massive, and they could be minimal, we won’t know until we measure it.</p>

<h3 id="the-dark-side">The Dark Side</h3>
<p>One major problem with the ability to perform calculations so quickly can be found in encryption. Currently our encryption models work using complex combinations of equations that are impossible to reverse engineer without trying every possible combination until the correct one is found. With our current computing ability, it would take hundreds of years and all our available computing power to break higher levels of encryption. It is this technology that protects some of the most important aspects of our digital lives, most notably our money. Quantum computers will be able to break this type of encryption quickly. This could bring the digital banking world to its knees, effectively rendering all digital currency worthless. To stop this from happening, a new type of encryption will need to be developed. (Möller, 2017)</p>

<h3 id="hi-gran-hows-the-tea">Hi Gran, How’s The Tea?</h3>
<p>Qubits have another very peculiar behaviour that could prove invaluable – quantum entanglement. Entanglement allows two qubits to be ‘paired’. Two paired qubits will always show the exact opposite polarisation of its partner. This behaviour is not dependant on space or time – it is instant no matter how far apart the qubits are. The chinese have recently proven this to be true from orbit. There are immense possibilities of quantum pairing in the world of communication. Imagine being able to talk to your Gran over tea in London, from your earth outpost in Alpha Centauri, instantly. Quantum computers could make this a thing. (Möller, 2017)</p>
