<h2 id="the-material">The Material<br /><br /></h2>
<p>This blog has been put together as a series of notes for a University module I am studying on software development.
The majority of the course material is to do with algorithms and comes from Thomas H. Cormen (et al.)’s Introduction to Algorithms 3rd Edition.
It is a comprehensive book and goes into great detail, I thoroughly recommend it if you are considering software development as a career or if you want to take your own programs to the next level.
The book contains mathematic proofs, pseudo-code and examples of algorithms and in-depth discussion for many of the best choice algorithms that have already been developed for many purposes.
<br /><br />
This series will translate some of that into plain English, and I will attempt in some parts to re-create pseudo-code and post the examples to GitHub.
But before we go any further, there are a few concepts that need to be understood;
<br /><br />
	- What are algorithms?<br />
	- The types of problems algorithms solve<br />
	- Data Structures<br />
	- Technique<br />
	- Hard problems, and<br />
	- Parallelism.
<br /><br /> 
The Book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Introduction-Algorithms-MIT-Press-Cormen/dp/0262533057">Introduction to Algorithms</a> can be bought from Amazon.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-are-algorithms">Algorithms are Algorithms<br /><br /></h2>
<p>There is a simple, and a not so simple description of algorithms.
The simple definition asks you to consider a task, for example making a cup of tea. You might get up from a chair, walk to the kitchen, fill a kettle with water and so on. This is a common example for an algorithm and at its heart it is true. An algorithm is a series of steps to solving a problem. There is however more to it than that.
More normally an algorithm is a computational procedure, that conforms to a few rules, it should be;
	- Well defined,<br />
	- Take a value, or set of values as input<br />
	- Give a value or set of values as output<br />
	- A tool to solve a well specified computational problem<br />
	- The problem should specify the desired relationship between input and output<br />
<br /><br />
There are many different kinds of problems algorithms solve, one common problem is the sorting problem. In the sorting problem, the input for the algorithm is a set of unsorted numbers, the algorithm should output those numbers in sequential order. There are many uses for an algorithm that solves this problem, and many ways to solve the problem. The book, and these blogs will look at some of them. We will also look at many other problems and solutions, and perhaps attempt a few that currently have no solution.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="data-structures">Data Structures<br /><br /></h2>
<p>The whole purpose of an algorithm is to manipulate data in a specified way. Because of this data must be accessed and modified. There are many ways to structure data and facilitate access, but no one structure is good for every purpose. For this reason, it is a good idea to have a strong knowledge of different data structures, and so some will be covered in the series as needed.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="technique">Technique<br /><br /></h2>
<p>The purpose of these blogs is to learn more about algorithms. Although there are already a huge number of well-defined algorithms to solve lots of different problems, there are also a countable infinity of problems, many of which do not yet have efficient algorithms written. Introduction to algorithms goes some way to helping to develop a method and technique for creating algorithms which will be explored later in this blog.
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="difficult-problems">Difficult problems<br /><br /></h2>
<p>As stated above, there are potentially an infinity of problems algorithms could solve. many of these don’t yet have solutions. There are a group of these unsolved problems that are interesting known as NP-complete. These are problems for which no efficient algorithm has yet been found, but it has not been proven that one does not exist. NP in NP-complete stands for nondeterministic polynomial
<br /><br /></p>
<h2 id="parallelism">Parallelism.<br /><br /></h2>
<p>Parallelism is the ability many modern processors have to run different tasks at the same time using multi-core technology. Algorithms have been around for some time, however many of them have been written for single core computers. We now live in the age of multi-core processors which can break problems up in a unique way and run different parts of them concurrently. Multi-core processing is a relatively new advancement and as such many existing solutions, and indeed all of the ones we will consider, assume single core processors. It may be interesting to consider different solutions to the problems at a later date that consider multi-core processing.
