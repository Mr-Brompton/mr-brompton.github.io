<h1 id="essential-resources-for-a-technopreneur">Essential resources for a Technopreneur.</h1>
<h4 id="matthew-brompton">Matthew Brompton</h4>

<p><a href="#tool-list">Just show me the list</a></p>

<p>Technopreneurship is a new breed of entrepreneurship says <a href="https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/312888">Dr Bala at Entrepreneur.com</a> and, although the term has been around since at least the 90’s there is no doubt that being technically savvy is a huge advantage in the process of bringing a product to market.</p>

<p>But being technically adept doesn’t always mean running racks of servers from your shed while fiddling with Rasberry Pis. Its is just as much, if not much more important to utilise the vast amount of tools at our fingerips to be creative, learn the necessary skills and to collaborate with the internets greatest resource. Humans.</p>

<p>So I have taken the time to put together a list of great places for a technopreneur to start their journer. Some of which I use regularly, others I intend to use in the future, but all of them offer something unique and vital.</p>

<h2 id="learning-the-basics">Learning the Basics</h2>
<p>It is so important for anybody entering the business community to get this right. Take the time to learn the basics of business administration and we will make considerable savings - not least on paracetemol - in the future.

<h2 id="build-a-solid-idea">Build a solid idea</h2>
<p>Once we have an idea of how to start and run a business day to day, we should start to think about our ideas. Of course ideas are everywhere but how do we refine them  into something more substantial? And how do we get past that initial mind-block when we sit down to hash it out?</p>

<p>A great place I’ve had a little look around is <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCT_88.htm">mindtools</a> who provide tools and tips for creativity. The site also has Leadership, Management, Strategy, Problem solving, Decision Making, Project Management, Time Management, Stress Management, communication skills, Learning Skills and Career Skills tools and tips</p>

<h2 id="project-management">Project Management</h2>
<p>So we have our idea, we have set up the business and know how to run it day to day, but what about managing all the tasks, people, teams and everything else that comes with project management?</p>

<p>A tool I use regurlarly for everything from organising groceries, to planning complex computer programs is <a href="https://trello.com/">Trello</a>, a web based listing and planning tool. Its has a simple drag and drop, list style interface that is extremely easy to pick up. The best part? It’s free plan gives everything an entrepreneur could want, including the ability to add and manage team and individual access to lists. As I programmer I would be lost without its <a href="https://bitbucket.org">bitbucket</a> intergration.</p>

<h2 id="collaboration">Collaboration</h2>
<p>Nothing is born in a vacuum. Creativity flourishes when we are around creative and like minded people. The strength of our idea depends on how it is percieved by others. We may have pitched to our Family, Freinds, Co-workers and our dogs. While doing so we have probably heard the same thing again and again, “That’s a great idea… I’ll take 10”. I have news for you, they are lying. Especially your dog.</p>

<p>But don’t fear, there are people out there who would be happy to run your idea ragged, and let you know where it falls flat - Which although painful is vitally important. I’m not going to list the obvious social media sites here, but here are some services that show promise:</p>

<p><a href="https://inbia.org/">InBIA - International Business Innovation Association</a> I haven’t signed up to this orgaisaion yet, however they describe themselves as “an entrepreneurship support organization that opperates in 62 countries. InBIA provides industry best practices through education while enabling collaboration, mentorship, peer-based learning and the sharing of innovative ideas for entrepreneurs across the globe.” I hope to review them in the future.</p>

<p><a href="https://quirky.com/">Quircky</a>, a very big collaborative invention community. This is another place I hope to check out soon.</p>

<h2 id="learning-advanced-business-management-concepts">Learning advanced business management concepts.</h2>
<p>It has been a long road, but we have finally found ourselves at a point where our product idea is strong but how do we implement it? I’m going to assume for brevities sake, that our product is a physical thing that needs manufacturing and not a service - as this is a completely different ballgame.</p>

<p>We should thank Richard Branson because here he comes to the rescue. <a href="https://www.virginstartup.org/how-to">Virgin</a> have some great learning and template resources to get us going. I will be studying this website in detail over the coming months, I will be sure to evaluate the quality of Mr. Bransons’s endevour thoroughly.</p>
