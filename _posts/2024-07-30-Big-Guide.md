## A Big Guide on Jekyll
Jekyll is a free and open-source static site generator. Unlike content management systems like Drupal or WordPress, Jekyll generates all the content at once, rather than waiting for visitors to access specific pages. It takes plain text written in your favorite markup language (such as Markdown) and uses layouts to create a static website. 

With Jekyll, you can easily transform your content into static sites without dealing with databases, comment moderation, or frequent updates. Permalinks, categories, pages, posts, and custom layouts are all first-class citizens in the Jekyll ecosystem. If you’re tired of hosting hassles, you can even deploy your Jekyll site for free using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

This guide is written with Ubuntu in mind, although steps should be similar on any operating system. The guide focuses on building a website, and It also doesn't contain any information about deploying a website. If I get a few requests, I may write that later.

{% raw %}
### Install
First, Install Ruby;
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```

Setup a #runy/gem installation directory.
```
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

finally, install Jekyll and Bundler;
```
gem install jekyll bundler
```

### Start a project
Create and move to a directory to house our projects;
```
mkdir myPRojects && cd myProjects
```

Create a new project Gemfile;

```
bundle init
```

Edit the gemfile;
```
nano gemfile
```

to add;
```
gem "jekyll"
```

Run bundle to install jekyll for the project;
```
bundle
```

It is possible to prefix all Jekyll commands listed in this guide with `bundle exec` to make sure you use the Jekyll version defined in your `Gemfile`.

#### Create a site
Create a new project directory, and move into it.
```
mkdir myProject && cd myProject
```

Create a new `index.html`. 
```
touch index.html
```

If you don't know what to put in it, try this...
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Home</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello World!</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now, we can choose to either only build the site, or serve the site to a local host.
To build the site into a subdirectory named _site;
```
jekyll build
```

to build and serve the site, forcing the browser to reload with each update;

```
jekyll serve --livereload
```

The site built locally is for development only. Later we will deploy the site.

### Using Liquid templates
Liquid is a templating language.

Liquid has three components;
 - Objects
 - Filters
 - Tags
Liquid/Objects Liquid/Filters Liquid/tags

#### Objects
Liquid/Objects  are predefined variables that are used to insert various types of content.
Use a pair of double curly braces for Liquid/Objects `{{ }}` .

To display a page title;
```
{{ page.title }}
```
The full [List of Liquid Object Variables](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-pages/configure/liquid/liquid-objects)

#### Tags
Curly braces and percent signs represent Liquid/tags: `{%` and `%}`
Tags are used to define logic and control flow;
```
{% if page.show_sidebar %}
  <div class="sidebar">
    sidebar content
  </div>
{% endif %}
```

Show sidebar if show_sidebar page variable is true.

The full [[List of Liquid Tags]]
#### Filters
I use Liquid/Filters less. They are represented using a pipe `|` inside Liquid/Objects .

```
{{ "hi" | capitalize }}
```

The full [List of Liquid Filters](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/filters/)

#### Front Matter
Liquid/Front-Matter

Liquid Templates are processed if we add front matter to the top of our page. For example

```
---
---

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>Home</title>
  </head>eky
  <body>
    <h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase }}</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```

Front Matter uses #YAML to set variables for a page.
```
---
my_age: 37
---
```

Call front matter variables using the `page` object variable.
```
{{ page.my_age }}
```

### Layouts
Jekyll/layouts are templates used to wrap around content.
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

Jekyll/layouts  are stored in the `_layouts` directory.

This also allows us to reduce the code we're using, and instead of #HTML we can use #Markdown created by #Aaron-Swartz as a more easily readable markup language.

We don't use front matter in Jekyll/layouts 

In the above layout, our content in our markdown page, will replace the `{{ content }} ` Object.

To use a particular layout, we set the layout variable in the front matter of the page. For example, an `index.html` may look like this;
```
---
layout: default
title: Home
---
<h1>{{ "Hello World!" | downcase }}</h1>
```

Because layouts wrap around content on our markdown page, we can call front matter like `page` in the layout file. When we apply the layout to a page, it uses the front matter from the markdown page.
```
---
description: "This is a description of the webpage, and can be shown if we use the page object."
---

{{ page.description }}
```

### Includes
Jekyll/includes Jekyll/tags #html/navbar
Include is a tag `{% include %}`, includes are repeated content or sections that are stored in an `_includes` folder.

Includes are great for any content that doesn't change across the site - or wherever it's included. An example may be a navigation menu, contact section, or a footer.

We can create a navbar using some html, and storing it in the `navbar.html` file, inside the `_includes` folder;
```
<nav>
  <a href="/">Home</a>
  <a href="/about.html">About</a>
</nav>
```

We can then add the include tag, wherever we want to put the navbar. Usually, at the top of any page body, a good place may be our default layout under the opening `<body>` tag.
```
  <body>
    {% include navbar.html %}
    {{ content }}
  </body>
```

This will add our navbar to any page that uses the default layout.

### Page Highlighting
Jekyll/tags Jekyll/variable 

We can use control flow and logic tags, as well as Jekyll variables to highlight the current page in the navigation bar.

To do so, we need to tell our navbar include the url of the page using the variable `page.url`. 

To make it so, add the following code to each anchor link in our navbar;
```
{% if page.url == "/index.html" %}style="color: darkOrange;"{% endif %}
```

to look something like;
```
<a href="/" {% if page.url == "/" %}style="color: DarkOrange;"{% endif %}>
    Home
  </a>
```

### Data

Jekyll/data

Jekyll can use three different data file formats, 
	1. [[YAML]]
	2. [[JSON]]
	3. [[CSV]]

All Jekyll data files are stored in the `_data` Directory.

[[YAML]] is commonly used with [[Ruby]] Ecosystems. 

We could use [[YAML]] to store our navigation menu items and links. First we would create a `navbar.yml` file in the `_data` directory with the following content;

```
- name: Home
  link: /
- name: About
  link: /about.html
```

We can the use the `site.data.navigation` variable to display the content;
```
<nav>
  {% for item in site.data.navigation %}
    <a href="{{ item.link }}" {% if page.url == item.link %}style="color: red;"{% endif %}>
      {{ item.name }}
    </a>
  {% endfor %}
</nav>
```

### Assets
#html/assets #javascript #css
Assets include things such as images, javascript, and CSS files.

They can be stored in the same way as we would in a standard web front end, inside a folder named `assets`, which should contain folders for each assets type.

```
├── assets
│   ├── css
│   ├── images
│   └── js
```

These folders will be copied to the site build, so they can be referenced like normal in HTML.

```
<html>  
	<head>  
		<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">  
	</head>  
	<body>
		<img src="/assets/img/pic_trulli.jpg" alt="Italian Trulli">
		<script src="/assets/js/myscripts.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>

```

#### Sass

#jakyll/sass
[[Sass]] (Not to be confused with Saas) is a way to compile many different CSS files into one, making it easier to manage as a set of smaller files.

##### Let's get Sassy

[[Sass]] is compiled into an `.scss` file. We should store our `style.scss` file in the usual location, `assets/css`., it should contain;

```scss
---
---
@import "main";
```

Front matter tells [[Jekyll]] to process the file.
By default, [[Sass]] will look in the `_sass` directory for any imports, so we should place `main.scss` in there.
```
├── _data
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _sass
│	   └── main.scss
├── _site
├── assets
│   ├── css
│	|	└── style.scss
│   ├── images
│	└── js

```

We can add our rules to `_sass/main.scss` in the usual way, using vanilla CSS.
```css
.current {
  color: darkOrange;
}
```

> **Note**
> The `style.scss` file will be compiled to the site build as `style.css`, meaning the link tag in the HTML will need to reference `style.css` for example `<link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">`

### Blogs

Jekyll/Blog 

[[Jekyll#Blogs|Jekyll Blogs]] are written in Markdown, and are very simple to write.

Our posts are added to a folder named `_posts`.

The filename must follow the naming convention, `yyyy-mm-dd-title.md`

our content should follow the same conventions as our already written markdown files;

```
---
layout: post
author: Mr-Brompton
---

## A Big Guide on Jekyll
Jekyll is a free and open-source static site generator. 
Unlike content management systems like Drupal or WordPress, 
Jekyll generates all the content at once, rather than waiting 
for visitors to access specific pages. It takes plain 
text written in your favorite markup language (such as 
Markdown) and uses layouts to create a static website. 
```

Next, we will need to create a new layout, named `_post`.
We can use the default layout in the post layout.
We can also use a `{{ page.date }}` variable, this will take the date from the filename. If we want the date to be more human readable, we can use a filter `{{ page.date | date_to_string }}`.
```
---
layout: default
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
<p>{{ page.date | date_to_string }} - {{ page.author }}</p>

{{ content }}
```

We will also need to list our posts, we can do this using the `{{ site.posts }}` variable wherever we wish to display them - This could be our index page or a dedicated `blog.html` file.

- `post.url` is automatically set by Jekyll to the output path of the post
- `post.title` is pulled from the post filename and can be overridden by setting `title` in front matter
- `post.excerpt` is the first paragraph of content by default

```
---
layout: default
title: Blog
---
<h1>Latest Posts</h1>

<ul>
  {% for post in site.posts %}
    <li>
      <h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
      {{ post.excerpt }}
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Finally, we should add a link to our blogs in our navbar;

```
- name: Home
  link: /
- name: About
  link: /about.html
- name: Blog
  link: /blog.html
```

### Collections
Jekyll/Collections
[[Jekyll#Collections|Collections]] are Jekyll's way of organising and grouping content.

To begin a collection, create (or edit if it exists) a `_config.yml` file in the project root folder.
```
├── _data
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _sass
│	   └── main.scss
├── _site
├── assets
│   ├── css
│	|	└── style.scss
│   ├── images
│	└── js
├── index.html
└── config.yml
```

To add a collection named 'guides', add the following content;
```
collections:
  authors:
```

If your Jekyll server is running, you'll need to restart it.

The pages in our collections, need to be placed in a folder with the naming convention `_*collection_name*`, for example our guides collection will be placed in the `_guides` folder.

While we are at it, we can create the first file in our collection;
```
├── _data
├── _includes
├── _layouts
├── _sass
│	   └── main.scss
├── _site
├── _guides
│	   └──Jekyll.md
├── assets
│   ├── css
│	|	└── style.scss
│   ├── images
│	└── js
├── index.html
└── config.yml
```

```
---
name: Jekyll
author: Mr Brompton
date_created: 14-07-2024
---
So, you want a Jekyll Guide huh?
```

Next, we can create a page for our new collection, here we will add 'guides.html' to our root folder, and add the following content;
```
---
layout: default
title: Guides
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<ul>
  {% for guide in site.guides %}
    <li>
      <h2>{{ guide.name }}</h2>
      <h3>{{ guide.author }}</h3>
      <p>{{ guide.content | markdownify }}</p>
    </li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

Here, the full guide content will be added to the page, later if we wish, we can create a description variable in our guide front matter, and output the description with a link to the guide - This is explained in [[Jekyll#Collections Pages|Collections Pages]]

When using a {{ content }} tag in a layout, the content is automatically assumed to be markdown. Here, because we are using {{ guide.content }} on a page, we need to run the markdown content through a markdownify filter `{{ guide.content | markdownify }}`,

and as usual, we can add the page to our navigation menu.

```
- name: Home
  link: /
- name: About
  link: /about.html
- name: Blog
  link: /blog.html
- name: Guides
  link: /guides.html
```

##### Collections Pages
Unlike [[Jekyll#Blogs|Blogs]], items in [[Jekyll#Collections|Collections]] don't automatically generate pages. To change this behaviour  we can add `output: true` to our collection in `config.yml`
```
collections:
  authors:
    output: true
```

Because we have changed our config, we will need to restart the server.

Then we can add the link to the Guides page,and perhaps add a description in the front matter of our guide.
```
---
layout: default
title: Guides
---
<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

<ul>
  {% for guide in site.guides %}
  <a href="{{ guide.url }}">
	    <li>
	      <h2>{{ guide.name }}</h2>
	      <h3>{{ guide.author }}</h3>
	      <p>{{ guide.description }}</p>
	    </li>
	</a>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
```

```
---
name: Jekyll
author: Mr Brompton
date_created: 14-07-2024
description: A big, one page jekyll guide, from start to finish.
---
So, you want a Jekyll Guide huh?
```

We should also create a layout for our guides;
```
---
layout: default
---
<h1>{{ page.name }}</h1>
<h2>{{ page.position }}</h2>

{{ content }}
```

Instead of adding the new layout to all our guides, we can keep our content [[DRY]] by putting it in our `config.yml`, and while we're at it, why not add defaults for all our pages...
```
collections:
  authors:
    output: true

defaults:
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "guides"
    values:
      layout: "guide"
  - scope:
      path: ""
      type: "posts"
    values:
      layout: "post"
  - scope:
      path: ""
    values:
      layout: "default"
```

### Gemfile
Jekyll/Gemfile

The [[Jekyll#Gemfile|Gemfile]] ensures the environment stays the same wherever your site is built or published.

To create a [[Jekyll#Gemfile|Gemfile]] open the project's root folder in the terminal, and type;
```
bundle init
```

We can add our [[Jekyll]] [[Jekyll#Gemfile|Gemfile]] entry using;
```
bundle add jekyll
```

To update gemfiles we can use;
```
bundle update
```

If we are using gemfiles, we should change our local serve command to,
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

If we publish our site with github, it's a good idea to use the [[Github Pages]] gem, instead of the [[Jekyll]] gem, and exclude `Gemfile.lock` in our `.gitignore` file.
```
bundle remove jekyll
bundle add github-pages
```

#### Plugins
There are some very useful [[Jekyll#Plugins|Plugins]] for jekyll.
[A list of plugins](https://github.com/planetjekyll/awesome-jekyll-plugins)

Here, we will add an RSS feed, a sitemap, and SEO tags.

First, we will manually add them to our gemfile, so that we can add them to a `jekyll_plugins` group.
```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem "jekyll"

group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-sitemap"
  gem "jekyll-feed"
  gem "jekyll-seo-tag"
end
```

Next we will add them to our `config.yml`
```
plugins:
  - jekyll-feed
  - jekyll-sitemap
  - jekyll-seo-tag
```

Install the gems with bundle, opening our project root folder in the terminal, we type;
```
bundle update
```

Some plugins require content to be added to pages, a good place to add them is the default layout;
```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <title>{{ page.title }}</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/css/styles.css">
    {% feed_meta %}
    {% seo %}
  </head>
  <body>
    {% include navigation.html %}
    {{ content }}
  </body>
</html>
```

{% endraw %}
