## AI Development Disasters and how to (Mostly) Avoid them

### Preamble. 

Around a week ago I gave a talk to a wonderful group people in a wonderfull resteraunt. 

I promised to write up that talk and share some of my research links, but due to parenting, partnering, working, learning, and building commitments, I haven't been able to.

Although I've had to ditch the talk write-up, I can keep to half of that promise. Below you will find the recorded talk and after trawling through my internet history, a collection of some of the links I read through in preperation for the talk. 

Please enjoy this further reading, there are some interesting stories in here.
