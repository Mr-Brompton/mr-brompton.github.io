OpenOffice is a product from Apache, which as the name suggests is an open source office suite comparable to some of the big names like Microsoft Office, with a very similar design to older versions of Microsoft word most people who have used word processing software would find it relatively simple to use.
</p>
<p>
Being open source means that the user not only benefits from free software but from the security that the open source community provides. With millions of people that run and use the software and the hundreds of thousands who read its source code, it would be very difficult for a person to exploit the software for malicious purposes and OpenOffice runs on Windows, OS X and linux so you don't even have to worry about compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Aside from these benefits though Open office can be a little archaic, with less functionality and editing options than its larger competitors but when a software is free to use, free from errors and free from advertising what more could you ask for?

This is a bog standard laptop that I purchased after ruining my good one. I needed something cheap and this does the job. It runs basic games with ease and will handle all of my writing needs. The only drawback is windows 10 and its insessant notifications. For example everyday, at least twice per day I get a 'purchase microsoft office' notification wich at the very least can be very annoying. If I didn't want to purchase it 4 hours ago why would I have changed my mind now?
</p>
<p>
Its battery life had duited me greatly however. As long as I have remembered to charge the battery it has never run out on me. That being said I am reasonably energy conscious and run my computer at a reasonable efficiency.
</p>
<p>
I have used each one of its functions, HDMI out, headphone/microphone jack, micro SD card slot, 2X USB inputs and have had no problems using bluetooth devices.
</p>
<p>
If your looking for something with all of the bells and whistles this isn't it. But if you just need to run basic applications and softwares and want something reasonably durable, practical and compact it is the perfect wallet suitable solution.

While I am writing, I like to sit outdoors and internet connection when I want to research something can be a real pain. I can't exactly plug into a tree. That is where this little gadget comes in handy providing me with a reliable wifi signal wherever I go. Its battery life is great and it handles most of my data needs BUT this is now an ancient peice of kit. I don't even think buying a new one would be a wise option although reasonably cheap for what it is, the data costs are now way too high with 4g offering a much cheaper alternative.
</p>
<p>
I also for a little while tried the Giff-Gaff Unlimited Data Plan and I have one word of advice. Don't.
</p>
<p>
EE's service has been great. That being said I have never had to call there customer service line and couldnt comment on this. I have scored them low because there are now much cheaper alternatives and EE have been slow to change prices to reflect this and so what is now a meagre 10gb costs &pound30.
</p>
<p>
It is pretty usable with only one button for turning it on or off and the connection password printed on the inside (if you're not savvy enough to change it). The combination serves me well for its current purpose though lets be frank. I will be upgrading at the first opportunity for the sake of my wallet and my sanity.
