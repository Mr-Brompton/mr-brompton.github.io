	<h1>Step One: Creating Space</h1>
	<img src="img/rsz_greatoak.jpg" alt="blogMainImage" />
	<p>
		It is important, not only in your physical life but in your digital life too, to seperate different areas of your life. When blogging, it is important to be completely focused on the task at hand without any distractions coming from your environment or your other to-do-lists.
	</p>
	<p>
		It would be awesome if all of us had an extra room in order to set-up as a &#39;blogging office&#39; and if you can, this is obviously the best route. However not all of us have that luxury, especially if like me you just rent a small room in which to sleep but there are other options.
	</p>
	<p>
		If you have space around your property you could set up a space, a computer desk, a bean bag with an occasional table, or even just a chair at your dining table that you don&#39;t usually sit in. This will help as your space will be available most of the time and you can pick&#45;up where you left off both physically and mentally with all of your resources close to hand.
	</p>
	<p>
		If this is not possible the next best (or in some people&#39;s opinion the absolute best) way to do this is to go out and buy or find a bag, put all of your resources for blogging into the bag, go for a walk and find a nice retreat perhaps next to a tree, a river in a park or coffee shop/public library where you can sit and work without distraction. One major benefit to this approach is that your &#39;office&#39; can be anywhere you please. In fact it wouldn&#39;t be too much of a stretch to start a new blog named &#39;My office today!&#39; in which you walk around looking for awesome places to work!
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		I personally like to sit by a tree, an old poet friend of mine wrote:-
		<div id="quote">
			<ul>
				<li>
					&#34;I know of a place, in roots at base
					<br />
					of a huge aging beech.
					<br />
					It&#39;s the shape of a chair, and while resting there
					<br />
					you&#39;ll learn unconceivable things.&#34;
				</li>
				<br />
				<li>
					<h5>-Pete Walsh</h5>
				</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</p>
	<p>
		Hailing from Nottinghamshire and growing up (unlike today) mostly outdoors, woodland is my heritage and it is where I find comfort. My dream space would be to write under The Great Oak(pictured), unfortunately this is out of the question as it is so old (estimated it could be 1,000) it has to be protected but thankfully there are for now at least, a great many trees to choose from.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		It is important that you spend time and effort putting your space together in order to make it as comfortable and enjoyable as it can be. You may wish to spend a little money at this stage decorating or furnishing your space. Whether this means a new chair, table, a lick of paint or just a nice easily carried cushion to sit by your tree on, making your space own will make you feel more creative and helping to add to the feeling of investment and reward.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Once you have created your physical space it is time to create your digital space. You might think that this means creating domains and web pages but infact because we are not yet publishing this can be very simple. All you will need at this stage is:
		<ul>
			<li>A Memory Stick</li>
			<li>An E-mail Address</li>
	</p>
	<p>
		Your memory stick can be any old stick you have lying around, or you can buy a nice shiny new one. The important thing is that you remove any existing data, you could even write &#39;blog&#39; on it or decorate it, if that is your thing.
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		The last thing to do is to create a new Email Address. This is so that any emails incoming for blogging are seperated from peronal and work accounts. It is possible to keep track of where I am at while being solely focused on blogging with no distractions from other tasks or information that might be coming in. I can also ensure that as this email will be published (placed all over the internet for people to contact me) I can keep any spam and/or hack attacks limited to just this one section of my life.
	</p>
	<p>
		I would suggest using a free account for now, with many sites offereing a free address, I suggest <a href="http://www.mail.com">mail.com</a>. I like mail.com as it has fantastic address customization and all for free. This way you can seem a touch more proffessional from the word go. <i>*I wasn't paid to say that either!</i>
	</p>
	<br />
	<p>
		Once you have done all of this you will have a space, and a ritual with which to get you &#39;in the mood&#39; for writing and working on this project, allowing for better focus and much greater productivity.
