<p>
OK, so I am new to blogging, I don&#39;t know where to start and I haven&#39;t written about anything in a long long time so what to write about first? Well I have a lot to choose from but I have decided that I would like to document my blogging progress in a step-by step format to enable other readers to do exactly as I am planning to do, also to give myself a guide to what to do next.
</p>
<p>
So in this blog I will look at a step by step approach to setting up a successful blog, documenting everything from conception to publishing and promoting so that the lessons I learn my be adapted by others seeking to add their experiences to an ever-growing blog-scape without being lost in the seamingly never ending sea of un-read and un-interesting posts.
</p>
<p>
I will start my journey using some basic tools that you should already be familiar with,
</p>
<ul>
	<li>A Word Processor (OpenOffice Writer)</li>
	<li>A laptop (Lenovo 100s)</LI>
	<li>An internet Connection <br />(Huwuei Modem on an EE connection)</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will review all of the products and servvices I use which will be found in my seperate blog <a href="https://bromptonsite.wordpress.com/category/b_reviews/">B&#95;Reviews</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p>
I plan to learn from the best. Taking online courses, reading forums and other how to&#39;s and taking advice from people around me who are already successful in this feild. I will review all of the tools that I test and use, and hopefully this will enable my readers to make informed choices and grow their own ideas as quickly and hassle free as possible. Once I have completed this blog I will also be in a position in which to write about my own subjects in a much more efficient and interesting manner.
</p>
<br />
<p>
The idea is to start from scratch, with a very basic text-only blog written with the writing skill I currently have in order to wach myself and track my progress, and in order that you may learn from my mistakes! So please forgive the basic format and boring layout for now, we will get around to making it more interesting later.
</p>
<br />
<p>
So, stick with me and together we will learn how to be a succesful blogger. If you have any interesting experiences, advice or resources you think will help me, or if you have any questions or ideas on what to cover next, please contact me at <a href="mailto:mr.brompton@mail.com">Mr.Brompton@mail.com</a>.
</p>
<br />
<p>
