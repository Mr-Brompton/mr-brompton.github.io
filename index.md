# Mr. Brompton

Hello there, thanks for stopping by. I'm Mr. Brompton, an IT and Security Engineer with a penchant for unraveling digital mysteries. Here's my tale:

- **Tech Lab Alchemist**: In a previous life, I stirred digital potions as a Computer Science lab technician at the University of Suffolk. Now, I Do the same on a massive scale for Huawei at a Microchip manufacturing Research and development plant.

- **Code Whisperer**: As a developer intern at 3A Design, I utilised my web front end, JavaScript, and linux experience, while teaching myself WebRTC and ffmpeg to develop a video streaming platform proof of concept.

- **Test Sorcerer**: My magical debut was as a test resource for Coderus. I conjured test cases, vanquished bugs, and even tamed unruly APIs.

- **Cyber Sleuth**: Armed with an BSc in Cyber Security from the University of Suffolk, I've become an open-source information ninja. If data hides, I seek it out like a caffeinated Sherlock.

- **Project Resurrector**: Stalled projects fear me. I resurrect them, dust off their digital cobwebs, and whisper, "It's time to shine, my dear codebase."

- **SIEM Summoner**: SPLUNK, ELK‚Äîthese are my mystical tools for peering into deep inner workings of any system. I dance with logs, unravel mysteries, and keep the digital realm secure.

- **Automation Enchanter**: ISO 9001? No problem. I automate complex manual QA processes faster than you can say "compliance."

- **Cyber Sentinel**: Cyber Essentials and ISO 27001? I've battled ransomware, built fortress-like email environments, and defended against attacks. My dissertation? Escaping Docker containers. Casual, really.

- **Lab Architect**: At Digitech Center, I designed and built the Cyber Security lab. Requirements from researchers, lecturers and the IT department clashed like titans, but I forged a path‚Äîlive and kicking for the next generation of tech wizards.

- **GPU Whisperer**: My Ubuntu-powered Nvidia GPU server at UOS hummed with computational might. Docker orchestrates the symphony of intensive workloads. It's like having a digital dragon in my corner.

So, welcome to my digital sanctum. I make stuff, break stuff, and weave code spells. Stick around‚ÄîI promise it won't be boring. üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®
