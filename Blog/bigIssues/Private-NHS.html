		<p class="intro">The NHS crisis is looming over the nation like a dark rain-cloud on an already freezing winters day. Nurses and Doctors are leaving the profession, or even the country in droves, in fact for the first time in history <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/nhs-nurses-leaving-more-joining-up-51-per-cent-four-years-midwives-jeremy-hunt-a7820141.html" target="_blank">more nurses and midwives are leaving the job than are joining it</a>. All the while different aspects of the vital service are contracted out often to the lowest bidder and the Tories make no secret of the fact that they would love a system <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/jeremy-hunt-privatise-nhs-tories-privatising-private-insurance-market-replacement-direct-democracy-a6865306.html" target="_blank">like that of the US</a>. It feels as if we are on a one way road to paying for our care through an insurance scheme that would see millions without care.</p>

		<p>It is often stated that capitalism is the most efficient monetary system the world has ever seen. Creating wealth and jobs, bringing people out of poverty and creating healthy competition in order to see services streamlined and cost effective. Is this true? If only there was a crystal ball we could look into that would tell us what a privatised public service would look like... Oh yes, there is.</p>
		<p>If we want to see what might happen if we did give incentive to profit in the healthcare sector we can look at several things. Of course we can look at the system in the USA where we will find huge numbers of those less fortunate unable to afford essential care and countless horror stories from those who can, but we can also look at the sectors and services in the UK that have already been privatised. The list is extensive, much longer than any other country in the world with <a id="blogLink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/4061613.stm" target="_blank">42 major businesses employing almost 900,000 people privatised before 1990</a> - so we'll have to narrow it down a little. Let's look at The rail network, telecommunications, manufacturing, prisons, the postal service and the care sector.</p>
		<p><b>The rail network</b></p>
		<p>A pole from the Guardian in 1999 suggested that 73% of all voters would support renationalising Railtrack.</p>
		<p>Rail privatisation was scrutinised heavily when first proposed in the 1980's under PM Margaret Thatcher with even Conservative MP's and lords rigorously defending public ownership. The <a id="blogLink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/982037.stm" target="_blank">privatisation of the rail network began in 1993</a> and was complete by 1997 under PM John Major. The service was split into multiple franchises and sold to a plethora of operators. Many of these operators are British companies with German state owned Deutsche Bahn now owning a considerable proportion.</p>
		<p>When first proposed, rail privatisation was supposed to deliver better and cheaper services. <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.raildeliverygroup.com/files/Publications/2016-11_rdg_dataset.pdf" target="_blank">A report by the Rail Delivery Group in December 2016</a> stated that both freight and passenger journeys have increased significantly, safety satisfaction and number of services have all increased, delay's are down but the impact of those delays are up, as is the average cost of rail fares with <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0018/21591/rail-fares-index-january-2016.pdf" target="_blank">an increase of 66.6% between 2004 and 2016 (over 72% for long distance journeys)</a>, or <a id="blogLink" href="http://actionforrail.org/the-four-big-myths-of-uk-rail-privatisation/">117%, or by 24% in real terms between 1995 and 2015</a>. Better? Perhaps. Cheaper? Most definitely not.</p>
		<p>Profit has been a difficult item to research. From what ABB can gather, <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1574708/Rail-companies-profits-fares-and-salaries.html" target="_blank">profits average around &pound;50million with operator First Group pocketing &pound;100million</a>. Net support for the industry provided by the public in 2015-2016 was &pound;4.8billion.</p>
		<p>If we divide the &pound;4.8billion by the 23 operators, that makes and average of &pound;209 million per company.</p>
		<p>In short we were promised a better and cheaper service through nationalisation. Although Key Performers Indicators (KPI's) show an average increase in satisfaction, fares have skyrocketed. With ToC's (Train operating Companies) often earning more than &pound;50 million in profit while receiving on average &pound;209 million in Government subsidies.</p>
		<p><b>Telecommunications</b></p>
		<p>Originally a part of the post office, <a id="blogLink" href="http://home.bt.com/news/bt-life/history-of-bt/a-short-history-of-telecommunications-in-the-uk-11363870786446" target="_blank">British telecom became a Plc. in 1984</a> as the first big British company to be privatised. Customer service records pre-1984 are difficult to come by so understanding value for money is difficult. However, we can see both current satisfaction levels compared to other landline providers and look at the share price over the last 30 years.</p>
		<p>According to <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.ofcom.org.uk/about-ofcom/latest/features-and-news/customer-service-satisfaction-levels-2014" target="_blank">OFCOM, satisfaction with BT</a> for landline services is fairly low at 61% compared to Sky's 79% we can see that this really isn't good enough. <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/personalfinance/investing/shares-and-stock-tips/9989430/Thatchers-legacy-how-has-privatisation-fared.html" target="_blank">Share price, despite a brief spike during the 90's dotcom boom has slowly dropped</a> in real terms over the years. All of this suggests a serious flaw in the system and a lack of ability to compete in the private sector.</p>
		<p>BT's profits have also been dropping. An accounting scandal can be blamed partly for this although it is hard to believe a <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0ahUKEwizpN-dlP3UAhXIBcAKHb77DB0QFghBMAQ&amp;url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/01/27/bts_profits_plunge_37_following_italian_job/&amp;usg=AFQjCNEFbgREg-bWqs2041KqbJO-EMVytQ" target="_blank">37% drop</a> can be put down to the one scandal. but one has to ask, with such incompetency, how can we trust such a private sector firm with arguably our most vital 21st century resource.</p>
		<p>Despite their recent setbacks, in 2016 <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.itv.com/news/2016-05-05/bt-pockets-3bn-profits-days-after-announcing-price-hikes-for-customers/" target="_blank">BT announced &pound;3 billion in profits shortly after raising the consumer cost by 15%</a>. BT also receives public subsidies often for investment in new projects. The most recent of which was a &pound;1.2 billion subsidy for its rural broadband upgrade investment. Both the Government and BT have defended the subsidy stating that the subsidies are &ldquo;excellent value for money&rdquo; ABB asks why, with profits of &pound;3bn, and BT likely to be the main profiteers of such investment, the money has to come from the public purse. This however, is a question for another time.</p>
		<p>BT's shares were originally intended to stay "at home" in the UK with shares split between employees and the public encouraged to buy way back in 1984 when the company was privatised. Now however BT's majority shareholders are a small group of American investment corporations including Renaissance Technologies, Blackrock inc, Northern Trust Corp and Bank of America Corp. This means that the &pound;3bn in profit sails across the pond to the shores of *cough* our biggest ally.</p>
		<p><strong>Manufacturing</strong></p>
		<p>You may think I am stupid. I can barely believe it myself but yes... Once upon a time a large proportion of British Manufacturing was public. I myself only found this out during the research of this post. looking at the <a id="blogLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_privatizations" target="_blank">list of privatisations</a> (Sorry, I know it's Wikipedia) it is easy to see that a whole treasure trove of manufacturing industries have been sold off over the years. Some of these industries and businesses include:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The Steel Industry</li>
			<li>The Coal Industry</li>
			<li>The Automotive industry (for example Jaguar and Rolls Royce)</li>
			<li>British Sugar</li>
			<li>British Shipbuilding</li>
			<li>Multiple aviation companies and airports</li>
			<li>Utility companies and infrastructure</li>
			<li>British Steel</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Take a look for yourself, <a id="blogLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_privatizations" target="_blank">the list seems endless</a>.</p>
		<p>It is impossible here, without an amazing mathematician, to work out the potential profits from all of these companies. ABB can only assume that they are massive.</p>
		<p>The reason we should look at these industries is this, quite frankly, many of them no longer exist and where they do, they often don't operate in the UK or are even now, looking to shift operations overseas.</p>
		<p>British Steel and British Coal for example have fallen victim to systematic break-up and sell off, or even just relentless closures. Manufacturing <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.ippr.org/files/images/media/files/publication/2011/05/manufacturering_in_uk_1285.pdf?noredirect=1" target="_blank">between 1992 and 2002 fell from 21% to 17%</a>. This doesn't seem like much but when you consider that output grew by 31% in that time this statistic is shocking.</p>
		<p><strong>Prisons</strong></p>
		<p>Not all prisons in the UK are private sector, however since 1992 14 of the UK's prisons have been privatised through contracts much like the contracts in the rail system. <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/private-prisons" target="_blank">Since 1990's contracts have been issued for running of services</a>, for most of the UK's 88,000 prisoners. A vast majority of the projects have been given to G4S, a company known for its failure in the delivery of the 2012 Olympic security contract.</p>
		<p>Problems in private prisons have been widely reported in recent months with G4S often at the centre of them. The sheer scale of atrocities and failures on the part of G4S is content suitable of a string of posts all by itself. Much like G4S prison staff however, but we are already overrun and must cut this down to size.</p>
		<p>Kev, an inmate at Oakley 'Super' Prison commented when <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/apr/29/tales-from-inside-oakwood-prison">speaking to the Guardian</a> "One day there were two new screws on together in charge of 60 men. They were asking me what to do to keep order. They hadn't got a clue." There are also reports of <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/shinealight/carolyne-willow/children-suffer-racist-abuse-and-degrading-treatment-by-guards-high-on-d" target="_blank">G4S Guards attacking children at Rainsbrook Prison</a>.</p>
		<p>Of course there is no want on the part of private companies, to take on such contracts unless profit can be made. Companies such as G4S often aim for profit <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/18/end-private-prisons/" target="_blank">margins of around 10%</a> on contracts worth, as far as ABB can tell around &pound;500 million each.</p>
		<p><strong>The postal service</strong></p>
		<p><a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/economics/11302648/Royal-Mails-privatisation-will-help-to-make-the-UK-economy-more-efficient.html" target="_blank">The Post Office was part privatised in October 2013 for &pound;3.30 per share</a>, with the Government retaining 30%. It has done pretty well in shareholder value since. There was a scandal here when its first investors sold their shares quickly while effectively doubling their money despite making the government promises of long-term stable investment. But that is not the question here.</p>
		<p>Although the public no longer pay subsidies to Royal Mail or directly pay for it through taxation, stamp prices have risen from <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.stampmagazine.co.uk/news/article/2013-royal-mail-stamp-prices/14716" target="_blank">60p and 50p</a> in 2013 to <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.royalmail.com/sites/default/files/Royal-Mail-Franking-Wallchart-March-17.pdf" target="_blank">65p and 56p</a> in 2017, much less than the price hikes experienced through other privatisations.</p>
		<p>Customer and employee satisfaction don't seem to have been affected and efficiency of service is as it always has been. There isn't much change from the public's perspective and so we can probably call this a privatisation success.</p>
		<p>Employees may disagree however as a <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/strike-action-in-the-post-over-a-second-class-royal-mail-pension-dvlsr2x5s" target="_blank">major pensions scandal</a> has ensued with strike action narrowly averted by Monday's new pensions deal.</p>
		<p>Only time will tell if we can truly call the Royal Mail privatisation a success.</p>
		<p><strong>The care sector</strong></p>
		<p>This was one of the first privatisations I actually remember. While walking past a council run care home with a friend of mine who happened to work inside, I was told that there were plans to close the home, sell the care contracts to private organisations and replace the majority of the service with "home care". I was young and na&iuml;ve and I have to say, I didn't believe it. I told her "The public won't let it happen. They will stand up and fight because many can't afford their own care there will be someone out there who knows how to put up a fight".</p>
		<p>Here we are, in 2017 and council run care homes are a thing of the past. This is a great example of how creeping privatisation works. Over the years contracts have been put out to tender, again using the rail network model until we have reached a situation whereby <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jun/21/privatisation-social-care-workforce-careers" target="_blank">three in four of the UK's care homes are run for profit</a>. Homes have been sold, demolished or replaced with a private sector equivalent all on the 'hush-hush'. The public didn't know what was happening and so they could not organise an effective response. Those who did know were often disbelieved and ignored. Something for which I will forever feel personally guilty for.</p>
		<p>This <a id="blogLink" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/why-social-care-privatisation-is-unsuccessful/" target="_blank">creeping privatisation of the care sector has happened over the past 30 years</a> or so and with the <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/articles/overviewoftheukpopulation/mar2017" target="_blank">population ageing</a> and with a <a id="blogLink" href="http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/why-social-care-privatisation-is-unsuccessful/" target="_blank">current financial size of &pound;22billion</a>, the sector is extremely attractive for investors and men (and women) in suits.</p>
		<p>The tragedy is however, that without a low cost, well regulated public service for care providing secure work for the profession, a combination of <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/careers/2016/jun/21/privatisation-social-care-workforce-careers" target="_blank">zero hour contracts</a> and minimum wage often attract the lowest of skilled workers.</p>
		<p>The care sector it has consistently failed, but it doesn't stop here. The private care sector is <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/press/press-releases/social-care-budget-cuts-damaging-nhs-latest-quarterly-monitoring-report-finds" target="_blank">Damaging the NHS</a> with delayed hospital discharges while failing to reduce emergency admissions. The sector is <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.kingsfund.org.uk/projects/new-gov/three-priorities-new-government" target="_blank">under funded</a>; it is <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-31001151" target="_blank">financially crippling</a> for users who often must sell their homes to pay for care. Care workers are overworked and underpaid with no job security, there are serious <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/12/05/care-home-fees-soar-one-quarter-quality-plummets-report-finds/" target="_blank">concerns about the quality of care</a> and all the while providers say the industry is on the <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.ft.com/content/e6c08ebe-0d47-11e7-a88c-50ba212dce4d?mhq5j=e1">verge of collapse</a>.</p>
		<p><br /><strong>Back to the NHS...</strong></p>
		<p><a id="blogLink" href="https://fullfact.org/health/how-much-more-nhs-spending-private-providers/" target="_blank">10% of NHS services are already contracted to private organisations</a>, this is a trend that is rising steadily. Private services often provide a cleaner, better and more optimised service and when I used one for an ultrasound scan during the appointment, I was impressed. This however did not last for long.</p>
		<p>After I received my scan I went about my business. After not hearing about any results for a while (for what was quite a sizeable scary lump on my neck) I found myself sat in front of an angry GP. I had booked an appointment to see if the results had come through only to find myself berated for not turning up to the scan. I had turned up. It eventually became clear that the scan had been 'lost', not seen for weeks and when it did eventually show up, it was found in my GP's private inbox and not in the system it should have been. A serious breach of data protection to say the least.</p>
		<p>Not only this but my GP was supposed to receive a letter after the scan, detailing the results that she could then forward to me. This didn't happen and instead, in an attempt to cover their tracks a letter was sent claiming I had not turned up.</p>
		<p>I am not alone in these incidents. Recently over <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.essexlive.news/over-9-000-nhs-health-records-lost-by-private-company-in-essex-suffolk-and-norfolk/story-29873676-detail/story.html" target="_blank">9,000 records were lost by private healthcare companies in Essex</a> and while speaking to a healthcare professional who wishes to remain anonymous, ABB has been told of the same private clinic mislaying or just not forwarding many medical records with NHS doctors and nurses often having to chase up results manually. This often wastes time and money that could be spent healing people.</p>
		<p>I should mention however that the care I received during my problem was ultimately second to none and I am eternally grateful to the great staff who helped me out immensely. I am forever indebted to our beautiful, public NHS.</p>
		<p><strong>Should we allow the creeping privatisation of the NHS?</strong></p>
		<p>Looking at the above evidence we can see that when a service is privatised, often profit is put before service. Hardly a privatisation seems to have been a success story in the past with the possible exception of Royal Mail, which has not been in private hands long enough for us to understand. It is difficult to see how a private NHS would work for the benefit of the people it serves while still striving to make a profit. Surely a better answer would be to re-think national insurance in such away that it covers the NHS bill.</p>
		<p><strong>What can be done?</strong></p>
		<p>Of course, as we saw with the care sector this is going to be a difficult fight. If you agree with ABB that it is a fight worth taking up there are some simple actions you can take.</p>
		<p><strong>Join a Union</strong><br />If you work in the NHS a great way to fight is by joining the union <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.unison.org.uk/at-work/health-care/key-issues/fighting-cuts-and-privatisation-in-the-nhs/" target="_blank">UNISON</a>.
