					<h2 class="title">Income Tax and VAT rises</h2>

					<p class="intro">Did I hear that right? In a political manifesto? That's bonkers! Surely you can't mean that we have been told which taxes will rise? Well, yes we have. In a bold and unusual move Labour have laid out their plans and made it quite clear. Those earning over &pound;80k will have a tax increase to 45p in every pound and those earning above &pound;123,000 will pay 50p. Let's go deeper.</p>
					<img id="feature1" src="../../img/Robin_Hood.jpg" />
					<p class="content"><!--<a href="..." >Link to nowhereid="blogLink"</a>-->Can Labour really be seen as the new Robin Hood? Strictly speaking this isn't a tax rise as the 50p rate was in place until the Tories cut it down to the 45p rate, while the 45p rate will merely be extended to include those 'workers' *cough* on &pound;80k+. It is clear that Labour sees that those at the top must contribute more for the services we all benefit from and the system that has fostered their growth, while almost nothing is left to pick from the bones of the countries services and benefits system.</p>
					<p class="content">According to the <a href="https://www.ifs.org.uk/publications/9230">IFS</a> Labour's plan will raise &pound;4.5bn per year and will protect 95% of the population from tax rises in the next Government. It is entirely possible that this tax could raise &pound;7billion per year if no-one changes their life-choices while it is also possible (if unlikely) that it could raise nothing.</p>
					<h2></h2>
					<p class="content">One of the main outcries against this argument suggests this will cause an increase in tax avoidance... Labour have thought of this and as you may have read in <a href="http://www.anotherblogblog.co.uk/Blog/GE2017/Tax-Avoidance.html">The Labour Manifesto |Tax Avoidance</a> , will be cracking down on this too. That doesn't however, stop people who control their income from say, dropping it to &pound;79,999 per year to avoid the rises.</p>
					<p class="content"> 
The next argument is that of the 'world economy' with many people, under the certain belief that if we raise income tax, many of the country's wealth creators will move away - a very valid concern. But we must ask ourselves where would they go? A quick look at <a href="http://www.tradingeconomics.com/country-list/personal-income-tax-rate">Global Tax Rate Table from Trading Economics</a> 	shows that there aren't many places to go. Sweden, Portugal, Japan, Denmark, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland and France all ranking above the 50p top rate with some rates going as high as 60p. There are already many countries that ask for more.</p>
					<p class="content"> 
 Labour's estimate of generated income is adjusted to reflect the various ways a person may alter their income in order to pay less tax, however for the vast majority of high earners (anything more than &pound;85k+) lowering their income wouldn't make much difference to their take-home, dropping &pound;5k to avoid &pound;4k does not make sense. A bit of a pointless option.</p>
					<p class="content"> As well as protecting the 95% of earners from NI and income tax rises, Labour have ruled out extending VAT to  food, children's clothes, books and newspapers and public transport fares while promising not to increase the rate of VAT. This does however leave a few things they could change their mind on. A few examples are- water supply, medical treatment and health care, bingo, lotteries, postage stamps, goods donated and sold in charity shops, betting/gaming and burial or cremation costs. But with the recent 'death tax' proposal from the Tories I think we can rule at least one of these out for its potential 'bad press'.</p>
					<!--<p class="quote">&quot;&quot; <br />-</p>-->
					<p class="content">So there is not much if anything that can be gained through VAT, but lowering the income tax 45p threshold and introducing a new 50p threshold Labour will raise roughly &pound;4.5billion, added to the &pound;6.5 billion through their tax avoidance plans gives us a total so far of &pound;11 billion raised, while we are yet to discuss many other income streams.</p>
