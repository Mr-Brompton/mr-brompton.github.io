			<p class="intro">Jeremy Corbyn... Well well, what can I say? I used to think you were a decent bloke but recently I must say I may have changed my mind. It's like someone has washed away all my positive thoughts about a leader who is kind, compassionate, strong enough to withstand a <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36647458" target="_blank">coup of 172 MP's</a> intent on destroying any hopes the Labour party had of being a left-wing representative party. If only there was a word to describe this cleansing of thought...</p>

			<p>Here you are, lording your victory over us doing things like <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36647458" target="_blank">riding the bus</a>. I mean, what sort of future PM really acts like the people he is hoping to lead? Because you are hoping to lead aren't you? I mean, everyone says you don't want to be the leader - that it was just <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34184265" target="_blank">your turn to stand</a>. I certainly don't believe that a reluctant leader, who sees himself as part of the team in anyway can be good at the task. It's not as if there are any <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/1848258755/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1634&creative=6738&creativeASIN=1848258755&linkCode=as2&tag=mrbrompton-21&linkId=50327d367c9c66a7d8ccd13671feaf9f">books on the issue</a><img src="//ir-uk.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=mrbrompton-21&l=am2&o=2&a=1848258755" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />, or even people at the forefront of the <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.skillpath.co.uk/on-site-blog/post.cfm/reluctant-leader" target="_blank">leadership field of expertise suggesting reluctant leaders are a good idea</a>.</p>
			<p>All of this is besides the point when I really think about it. How can I, in good conscience, vote for a man who has <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11924431/Revealed-Jeremy-Corbyn-and-John-McDonnells-close-IRA-links.html" target="_blank">stood next to another man from the IRA</a>. Never mind the fact that your actions helped work towards the lasting peace that we now all enjoy or that you have <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.rt.com/uk/311827-corbyn-british-army-ira/" target="_blank">repeatedly condemned the actions</a> on BOTH sides of that terrible war.</p>
			<p>Yes Jeremy, now we all know you can't hide behind your back-bench anymore. Take your place in the firing line so that we can all take pot-shots at you like those terrorists with which you symapathise take shots at us. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't me, <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-accuses-corbyn-of-being-terrorist-sympathiser" target="_blank">David Cameron called you, Mr. Corbyn the terrorist sympathiser</a> and of course <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/10-big-policy-promises-broken-6965585" target="_blank">David Cameron would never lie to us</a>. By my reckoning if those pesky terrorists hate pork, <a id="blogLink" href="http://time.com/4043311/david-cameron-pig-gate-scandal/" target="_blank">anyone who likes bacon so much</a> must be honest.</p>
			<p>And then there is my FAVOURITE MP Mr. BJ. Now, I don't know any <a id="blogLink" href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10999/boris_johnson/uxbridge_and_south_ruislip/votes" target="_blank">decisions Boris has made</a> but I do know that he makes me laugh. He called you a <a id="blogLink" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugwumps" target="_blank">mugwump</a> A word I have never heard of but that apparently does have a definition*. If he calls you a Mugwump, a mugwump you must be</p>
			<p>So who do you think you are kidding Mr. Corbyn? When you think the Tories are done? Just because you have consistently out-performed Therasa May, <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/Images/manifesto-2017/Funding%20Britain%27s%20Future.PDF" target="_blank">properly costed your manifesto</a> and are <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-latest-labour-party-conservative-party-poll-survation-good-morning-britain-a7762371.html" target="_blank">closing the gap in the polls</a> it doesn't mean you get my vote. Nah, I think I'll give it to that guy who wants to legalise weed... What was his name again?</p>
			<p id="quot">"a person who remains aloof or independent, especially from party politics. It originates from North American politics and dates back to 1832"<span id="ref"><br />-Google. Congratulations BJ. I like something you said.</span></p>
			<h3>Back to reality</h3>
			<p>If you find yourself using the arguments above please take a second to question your sources. Find something that you truly disagree with, or better still - something you agree with that can be backed up. You have a world of information at your fingertips. You can question us on economics, the welfare state, <a id="blogLink" href="http://www.anotherblogblog.co.uk/Blog/GE2017/Tax-Avoidance.html" target="_blank">Tax Avoidance</a>, education or just policies in general. Please do, I could use the mental exercise.</p>
			<p>I must confess... The bait was there, I had to take it. I've heard statements like those above repeated so often and heard so little considered and thoughtful response I felt the opportunity could not be missed. I'm sorry, I think.</p>
			<p>My next post will return to the Labour Manifesto. With time running short I will be overviewing the manifesto costings and hopefully allowing me a little time to focus on other issues 'JC and the Big Bad BREXIT Monster' is a working title.
