					<p class="intro">Jeremy Corbyn... Well well, what can I say? I used to think you were a decent bloke but recently I must say I may have changed my mind. It's like someone has washed away all my positive thoughts about a leader who is kind, compassionate, strong enough to withstand a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-36647458" id="blogLink" target="blank">coup of 172</a> MP's intent on destroying any hopes the Labour party had of being a left-wing representative party. If only there was a word to describe this cleansing of thought...</p>
					<img id="feature1" src="../../img/Corbyn-off-duty.jpg" />
					<p class="content"><!--<a href="..." >Link to nowhereid="blogLink"</a>-->Here you are, lording your victory over us doing things like <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/jeremy-corbyn-rides-night-bus-6175223" id="blogLink" target="blank">riding the 	bus</a>. I mean, what sort of future PM really acts like the people he is hoping to lead? Because you are hoping to lead aren't you? I mean, everyone says you don't want to be the leader - that it was just <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34184265" id="blogLink" target="blank">your turn to stand</a>. I certainly don't believe that a reluctant leader, who sees himself as part of the team in anyway can be good at the task. It's not as if there are any <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books/about/The_Reluctant_Leader.html?id=_603DgAAQBAJ&source=kp_cover&redir_esc=y" id="blogLink" target="blank">books on the issue</a>, or even people at the forefront of the <a href="http://www.skillpath.co.uk/on-site-blog/post.cfm/reluctant-leader" id="blogLink" target="blank">leadership field of expertise suggesting reluctant leaders are a good idea</a>.</p>
					<p class="content">All of this is besides the point when I really think about it. How can I, in good conscience, vote for a man who has stood next to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/11924431/Revealed-Jeremy-Corbyn-and-John-McDonnells-close-IRA-links.html" id="blogLink" target="blank">another man from the IRA</a>. Never mind the fact that your actions helped work towards the lasting peace that we now all enjoy or that you have <a href="https://www.rt.com/uk/311827-corbyn-british-army-ira/" id="blogLink" target="blank">repeatedly condemned the actions on  BOTH sides of that terrible war</a>.</p>
					<h2></h2>
					<p class="content">Yes Jeremy, now we all know you can't hide behind your back-bench anymore. Take your place in the firing line so that we can all take pot-shots at you like those terrorists with which you symapathise take shots at us. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't me, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/dec/01/cameron-accuses-corbyn-of-being-terrorist-sympathiser" id="blogLink" target="blank">David Cameron called you, Mr. Corbyn the terrorist sympathiser</a> and of course <a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/10-big-policy-promises-broken-6965585" id="blogLink" target="blank">David Cameron would never lie to us</a>. By my reckoning if those pesky terrorists hate pork, anyone who <a href="http://time.com/4043311/david-cameron-pig-gate-scandal/" id="blogLink" target="blank">likes bacon so much</a> must be honest.</p>
					<p class="content">And then there is my FAVOURITE MP Mr. BJ. Now, I don't know any <a href="https://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10999/boris_johnson/uxbridge_and_south_ruislip/votes" id="blogLink" target="blank">decisions he has made</a> but I do know that he makes me laugh. He called you a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mugwumps" id="blogLink" target="blank">mugwump</a> A word I have never heard of but that apparently does have a definition*. If he calls you a Mugwump, a mugwump you must be.</p>
					<p class="content">So who do you think you are kidding Mr. Corbyn? When you think the Tories are done? Just because you have consistently out-performed Therasa May, <a href="http://www.labour.org.uk/page/-/Images/manifesto-2017/Funding%20Britain%27s%20Future.PDF" id="blogLink" target="blank">properly costed your manifesto</a> and are <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/general-election-latest-labour-party-conservative-party-poll-survation-good-morning-britain-a7762371.html" id="blogLink" target="blank">closing the gap in the polls</a> it doesn't mean you get my vote. Nah, I think I'll give it to that guy who wants to legalise weed... What was his name again?</p>
					<p class="content">...</p>
					<p class="quote">*A Mugwump, according to google is a person who remains aloof or independent, 	 especially from party politics. It originates from North American politics and dates back to 1832. Congratulations BJ. I like something you said.</p>
					<p class="content">If you find yourself using the arguments above please take a second to question your sources. Find something that you truly disagree with, or better still - something you agree with that can be backed up. You have a world of information at your fingertips. You can question us on economics, the welfare state, <a href="http://www.anotherblogblog.co.uk/Blog/GE2017/Tax-Avoidance.html" id="blogLink" target="blank">Tax Avoidance</a> , education or just policies in general. Please do, I could use the mental exercise.</p>
					<p class="content">I must confess... The bait was there, I had to take it. I've heard statements like those above repeated so often and heard so little considered and thoughtful response I felt the opportunity could not be missed. I'm sorry, I think.</p>
					<p class="content">My next post will return to the Labour Manifesto. With time running short I will be overviewing the manifesto costings and hopefully allowing me a little time to focus on other issues 'JC and the Big Bad BREXIT Monster' is a working title.
