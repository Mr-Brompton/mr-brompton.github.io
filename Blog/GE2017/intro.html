					<h2 class="title">Creating an economy that works for all</h2>
					<h5>Matthew Brompton</h5><div id="blueBox" class="animated pulse"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/Brommo1" target="_blank"><img id="fb" src="../../img/fb.jpg" /></a></div>
					<br /><div class="fb-like" data-href="http://www.anotherblogblog.co.uk/Blog/GE2017/intro.html" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-show-faces="true" data-share="true"></div>
					<p class="intro">The Labour Party Manifesto has been leaked this week and well... It's a corker. Gone are the centralist days of Blair and the 'Tory light' era of Ed Milliband is consigned to the political graveyard *cough*.</p>
					<img id="feature1" src="../../img/Jeremy-Corbyn.jpg" />
					<p class="content">But what does this mean for the Reds? While the Blues are busy building opportunities... like opportunities to wave 'Strong and Stable' in our faces, team Corbyn has been busy tearing out the guts of Labours past and filling their manifesto with proposals that, on the surface seem radical and overstretched. But will they cost as much as the mainstream media are being so relentless in reporting? Will peoples lives be any different? Above all, are they really as economically sound as the Corbynistas claim?<!--<a href="..." id="blogLink">Link to nowhere</a>--></p>
					<p class="content">This is what I intend to find out in this series of blogs. I am trawling through the leaked version of the manifesto as we speak, intending to work out exactly how viable these aims and objectives are and how economically sound the future of Great Britain would be under a red leadership.<!--<a href="..." id="blogLink">Link to nowhere</a>--></p>
					<p class="content">Whether you are a 'hardcore Corbyn supporter, a blue through and through, or simply haven't made your mind up, keep reading as over the next few weeks I will look at the policies, the costs, where the money is coming from and other countries that have adopted similar approaches while intending to work out how realistic a 'Corbyn future' is.<!--<a href="..." id="blogLink">Link to nowhere</a>--></p>					
					<p class="content">The first section is mostly an introduction, however there are some interesting ideas introduced . The scene of this 'novel' of a manifesto is stark. Labour speak of a rigged economy and the ultra rich top 10% not paying their fair share while wages in real-terms are much lower than they should be.</p>
					<p class="quote">&quot;Working people in Britain today are earning less in real terms than they did ten years ago - and six million people earn less than a real living wage.&quot;</p>
					<p class="content">What will Labour do about it? A ten-year national investment plan. Sounds great and according to labour will create world-leading digital, transport and energy infrastructure. Fantastic. Contries such as Germany and Ghana (and many many others) are already doing this to great success.</p>
					<p class="content">Of course this is just an introduction and doesn't go far enough into detail but it is a great start. Government policies of recent decades have been far too short term which has led to most of the problems we see today. Headline grabbing policies are great to keep you in power but in reality it takes much longer than a 4 or 5 year term to build positive change and develop a country... In the same way a person might build a strong business over decades, countries must have long-term goals and long term thinking in order to thrive.</p>
					<p class="content">You could take an example here from the finance and investment sector and compare companies with long-term vision such as Google and to those that seek quick returns for shareholders such as BHS. We all know who is more successful.</p>
					<p class="content">Peter Murray, chairman of discussion forum New London Architecture stated that (Quote from FT.com)</p>
					<p class="quote">&quot;Taking the long-term view increases the overall quality of the place and that is better for the people&quot;</p>
					<p class="content">So a long term view it seems is the way forward and finally a mainstream political party has this exact view.</p>
