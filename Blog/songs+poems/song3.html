You know you've met him<br />
in the street<br />
he's got dreadlocks,<br /> 
odd shoes on his feet.<br />
A smile to greet those who pass him by,<br />
but go-on look closer he's wise in disguise.<br /><br />

You know he's lost what we cannot give up,<br />
our sanity is just illusion of trust<br />
in the system, believe in the state,<br />
while every four years we vote our freedoms away.<br /><br />

To polititions it seems obvious,<br />
Take from the poor give to the prosperous.<br />
Do I let them, take whats mine?<br />
They are the one we are the 99.<br />
<br />
Mass migration of the data generation,<br />
browsing from your TV<br />
Watching your cat vids and paying their taxes, to<br />
fund drones on killing sprees.<br />
Using religion to further their vision, a<br /> 
world out variety.<br />
No reason to succeed, No freedom to speak free,<br /> 
no system in which to achieve.<br />
<br />
To polititions it seems obvious,<br />
Take from the poor give to the prosperous.<br />
Do I let them, take whats mine?<br />
They are the one we are the 99.<br />
